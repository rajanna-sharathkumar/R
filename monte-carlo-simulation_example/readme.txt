A program is divided into 3 blocks that are being compiled on 3 parallel computers. Each
block takes an Exponential amount of time, 5 minutes on the average, independently of
other blocks. The program is completed when all the blocks are compiled. Compute the
expected time it takes the program to be compiled.
