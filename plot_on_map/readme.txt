Use  R  to  make  three  maps  of  the  states  in  the  USA.  The  first  map 
should  plot  state level income  share  of  the  top  1%  of income earners in  2012. 
The  second  map  should  plot  the  same  variable  but  for  1999.  The  third  map 
should plot the 2012C1999 difference of the variable.
